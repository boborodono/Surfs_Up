# Surfs_Up

## Overview:
    The purpose of this analysis is to determine the best location on the island for a surfing and ice cream shop. We analyzed temperature and precipitation patterns for various locations on the island to determine the best times of year to open the first location.

## Results:
    - The average temperature for the month of June for the last seven years has been around 75 degrees fahreinheit with minimum and maximum recorded temperatures of 64 and 85 degrees, respectively.

    - June temperatures are relatively consistent and only tend to fluctuate by +/- 10 degress. The frequency of temperatures in June is evenly distributed and there are few outliers. December temperatures cluster around 73 degrees but the distribution is skewed to the left.



## Summary:
    With temperatures and precipitation at acceptable levels for the months of both June and December... We believe either of these months to sufficient times to open the first store.

### Rain Frequency in December
    - While it does rain often in Hawaii, the amount of rain that falls each day is relatively small in the month of December. Storms seem to be more active during this month and the average day gets more rain on average than June. However, we think that even on days with less than .25 inches of rain it would be profitable to keep the store open for business.

    - This means that for more than 90% of all days in December there will be opportunity to sell surfing supplies and ice cream to potential customers.

## Analysis
    - The average daily rainfall is about .08 inches per day difference between June and December. That's a very small difference in overall rainfall but the standard deviation is more than .2 inches higher in December. This means that when it does rain there is a greater chance the rainfall wil be heavier in December.
    - This is also somewhat confirmed in the fact that the maximum rainfall in inches is 6.4 inches in December vs. 4.4 inches in June.
